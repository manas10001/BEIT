            <p>
              As a traveller, hill stations and forests are eternal favourites during all seasons . And the Western Ghats, one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites  has many of these pristine destinations tucked away in its fold. Traversing across the Western coast, the mountains wrap Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa and even parts of Tamil Nadu and Gujarat in its fold covering 56,825 sq feet. Apparently 17, 340 sq feet of the mountains are spread in Maharashtra alone. Mahabaleshwar is one of the picturesque destinations that is tucked away in the Western Ghats. It was once the summer capital of the British and even today it retains its colonial touch. Perched on the Sahyadris , the local name for the Western Ghats, the hill station located in Satara district of Maharashtra lures many a tourist . Monsoon is one of the best times to visit Mahabaleshwar. <br>
              Mahabaleshwar includes three villages Old Mahabaleswar, Malcolm Peth and Shindola Village . However most of the tourist spots are in Old Mahabaleswar which is a Kshetra. The source of the River Krishna is believed to come from the mouth of a cow carved in the old temple here. Four other rivers flow out of the spout which include Koyna, Venna, Savitri and Gayatri. The Panchganga Temple beckons both locals  and tourists as devotees throng to get a darshan of the river.

              As the cold breeze caresses my cheek and the mist unveils the landscape around me, Lonavala in the monsoon looks straight out of a dream.  From stunning views to hill forts, gushing waterfalls to overflowing lakes, ancient lakes to old temples, there are several places to see in Lonavala. it seems straight out of  Bollywood’s playground like its twin, Khandala. The rocky cliffs beckon many an adventure traveler while I camp under the stars. The forts near Lonavala take you on a Maratha trail. Old hotels and bungalows tell me ghost stories. I gaze at the valleys below, munching corn pakodas as the rocks take the form of a thumb or a snake’s hood. The locals swear that tigers used to roam around here at one time . As I drive through the forests, sipping chai and munching into vada pavs, I chat with people who tell me several tales. Even the famous “Lonavala chikki” they say, had its origins in a little hut. <br>
              The origins of this hill station that is perched in the Sahyadri Mountains or the Western Ghats take you back centuries in time. A magic carpet transports you to the first century when mountains were carved into carved into caves that became resting places for Buddhist monks. Hence the name Lonavali, referring to a series or “avali” of “len” or resting places in stone. There are three ancient caves here – Karla Bhaja Caves and Bedse Caves and each of them is a complex of several caves with stupas and monasteries carved inside them. These caves should definitely be in your list of places to see in Lonavala besides the forts of Lonavala.  Historically the Yadavas held sway over it before the Malva warriors of the Marathas made it their turf. Eventually it became a haunt of the British who used it as their hunting grounds pun intended.

              Kerala is synonymous with the backwaters but forget the Vembanad Lake and head to Ashtamudi near Kollam, one of the best places to see in Kerala. Personally I like this lake, second largest after Vembanad, which is believed to spread out like the arms of an octopus. We went cruising in the lake, listening to the tales of fishermen who told me a trick or two about their trade. Besides Kochi, this was one of the few destinations, where I saw Chinese fishing nets and it brought back memories of childhood. I recommend it as one of the top 10 places to visit in Kerala.

            <p>
              Kaziranga National Park is a national park in the Golaghat, Karbi Anglong and Nagaon districts of the state of Assam, India. The sanctuary, which hosts two-thirds of the world's great one-horned rhinoceroses, is a World Heritage Site. According to the census held in March 2018 which was jointly conducted by the Forest Department of the Government of Assam and some recognized wildlife NGOs, the rhino population in Kaziranga National Park is 2,413. It comprises 1,641 adult rhinos (642 males, 793 females, 206 unsexed); 387 sub-adults (116 males, 149 females, 122 unsexed); and 385 calves. In 2015, the rhino population stood at 2401. Kaziranga is home to the highest density of tigers among protected areas in the world, and was declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006 (now the highest tiger density is in Orang National Park, Assam) . The park is home to large breeding populations of elephants, wild water buffalo, and swamp deer. Kaziranga is recognized as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International for conservation of avifaunal species. When compared with other protected areas in India, Kaziranga has achieved notable success in wildlife conservation. Located on the edge of the Eastern Himalaya biodiversity hotspot, the park combines high species diversity and visibility.
              <br>
              Kaziranga is a vast expanse of tall elephant grass, marshland, and dense tropical moist broadleaf forests, criss-crossed by four major rivers, including the Brahmaputra, and the park includes numerous small bodies of water. Kaziranga has been the theme of several books, songs, and documentaries. The park celebrated its centennial in 1998 after its establishment in 1905 as a reserve forest.

            <h4 class="media-heading">Pondicherry</h4>
            <p>
              Pondicherry to me has always been a mix of what is both familiar and exotic at the same time.  Having grown up in Chennai, my weekend was all about Pondicherry travels and tales. I used to be in Pondy almost every holiday or weekend and I used to think that I had seen it all. From tequila shots to delicious crepes, we used to visit some of the best bars in Pondicherry and restaurants and cafes as well. And yet the town surprises me on very trip. It is not just about the beaches of Pondicherry or the temples and churches. It is neither the French Quarter of Pondicherry nor the Tamil quarter which lies separated by a canal. Beyond the colonial flavour and the spiritual fervour, Pondicherry has many stories hidden in it. Perhaps that is what Yann Martel thought when he set Life of Pi in this town.
              <br>
              Walking along the beach in the old French quarters of Pondicherry, the statue of Dupleix looks down at me . At the other end is a Gandhi statue surrounded by ancient pillars.” There was once a jetty here, even a railway line with a wagon car ,” says my guide Ashok Panda from INTACH as we walk along the colourful streets painted in pink and yellow. He points to some of the old warehouses that are still around ,  although some of them seem to have found a new lease of life as shops and restaurants while some have become some of the best bars of Pondicherry.
